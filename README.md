🔍 Binary Search Visualizer
Binary Search Visualizer is an interactive web application that demonstrates the working of the Binary Search Algorithm step by step. Designed with a clean and intuitive interface, it allows users to enter a sorted array, choose a target value, and watch as the algorithm efficiently finds the element.

✨ Features
✅ Step-by-Step Visualization – See each comparison in real-time.
✅ User Input Support – Enter custom sorted arrays and target values.
✅ Dynamic Animations – Highlights the searching process.
✅ Fast & Efficient – Showcases the power of binary search.
✅ Responsive Design – Works across all devices.

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ Enter a sorted array of numbers.
2️⃣ Choose a target value to search for.
3️⃣ Click Start Search to begin visualization.
4️⃣ The algorithm highlights the middle element and eliminates half of the search space until the target is found.

🎯 Why Binary Search?
🔹 Time Complexity: O(log n), making it much faster than linear search.
🔹 Efficient Searching: Works best on large sorted datasets.
🔹 Fundamental Algorithm: Used in competitive programming and real-world applications.

🔥 Future Enhancements
🔹 Support for different search algorithms (e.g., Linear Search).
🔹 Speed Control for animations.
🔹 Dark Mode for better accessibility.
